minikube start

Create Fintrack namespace - kubectl create ns fintrack

Set active K8s namespace to fintrack,  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=fintrack

Create backend K8s Secret - kubectl apply -f fintrack-backend-secret.yaml

Create backend K8s Deployment + Service - kubectl apply -f fintrack-backend.yaml [Ensure that Docker image is latest]
[Pray that everything starts up properly]

Create frontend K8s Deployment + Service (LoadBalancer) - kubectl apply -f fintrack-frontend.yaml[Ensure that Docker image is latest]

Run the following command in another terminal window, minikube tunnel
[Reasoning for using this, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44110876/kubernetes-service-external-ip-pending]

[ Pray that frontend can fire requests to the backend, most likely this will fail :( ]

You need to setup Ingress for this to work

Set up the Ingress file as written and apply it - kubectl apply -f fintrack-ingress.yaml

Wait till Ingress is assigned an IP address,
kubectl get ingress (note down IP address)

Note: You need to update the file /etc/hosts at the end with the syntax,
<IP Address of Ingress> <domain name specified in Ingress>
In my case it looks like, 192.168.49.2	fintrack.com

Also you need to update the API URL that the frontend hits to, fintrack.com/api instead of whatever it was before
And Ingress will take care of rerouting everything

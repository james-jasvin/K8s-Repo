/*
  Some things to note for future scope,
  
  Can use reactjs-popup to replace the alert window dialog boxes
  Can add react-alerts to replace the basic notification system that we have going on right now,
  but its a bit of a work to integrate so :P

  Test with more stocks and MFs in the DB => Think of a method to add more instruments in the DB via a portal
  => Add API but what about security? Add admin login?
  
  Think of possibilities where elements can be deleted at backend but still appear at frontend or
  not added at frontend but already added at backend

  The following point is invalid now because MongoDB objectIDs are no longer dependent on MAC address and things like that
  but still it's a nice point to note
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4587523/mongodb-is-it-safe-to-use-documents-id-in-public
  Don't store user id on localStorage, send only the JWT token, create a mapping from token to user id or extract
  user id from token & secret

  Add expiry timer to JWT tokens if possible
  Add better error messages in Notifications instead of straight up backend errors
  Use HashiCorp's Vault to not be dependent on Ansible Vault
  Can use TradingView as stock API to fetch stock prices & MFAPI.in for fetching MF prices (https://www.mfapi.in/)
  Use Sentry for monitoring instead of ELK
